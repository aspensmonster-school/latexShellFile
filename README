I'm assuming you already have some sort of TeX suite installed on your system.
Something like TexLive would work. Once you have that installed, you can
compile your .tex files using something like this to make pdf's:

pdflatex mylatexfile.tex

Make sure the "IEEEtran.cls" file is in the same directory as the tex file
you are compiling. Or you can compile it into your TeX suite. Either way.
No pressure.
