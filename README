I'm assuming you already have some sort of TeX suite installed on your system.
Something like TexLive would work. Once you have that installed, you can
compile your .tex files using something like this to make pdf's:

pdflatex mylatexfile.tex

Make sure the "IEEEtran.cls" file is in the same directory as the tex file
you are compiling. Or you can compile it into your TeX suite. Either way.
No pressure. 

I've included a pdf of my first lab report to give you an example of what
output can look like. It's in this repo as "example.pdf". You'll have to
clone the repo to see it though. This command should do the trick.

mkdir sometempfolder
cd sometempfolder
git clone https://github.com/aspensmonster/latexShellFile

If for some reason you can't get the example pdf from cloning, then grab
it from here:
